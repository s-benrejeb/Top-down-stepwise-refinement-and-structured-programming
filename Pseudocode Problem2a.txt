Problem 2.a

set initial value to 0
set increment to 0

prompt user to enter new value
user inputs new value

if the value entered is equal to 0 or 1
	set factorial of these values to 1 (by theorem)
	output factorial of 1 or 0 is equal to 1

else if the value is negative
	output error because factorial to negative values do not exist

else if the value is positive and and different from 1 and 0
	set factorial equal to value
	while the increment is smaller than the input value
		calculate factorial ( current factorial*(value-increment)
		increase increment by 1
	output the final factorial assigned by the loop
