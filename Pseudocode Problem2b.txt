Problem 2.b

set input number to be initially 0

prompt user to enter new number
user inputs new number

if the number is strictly bigger than 1
	Set factorial equal to input number
	Set increment to 1
	For increment starting at 1 and increasing by 1 after each loop, 
	as long as it is strictly smaller than the input number
		calculate factorial (current factorial * (number-increment))
	output the final factorial value

else if the input number is equal to 0 or 1
	set factorial to 1 (by theorem)
	output the factorial

else if input number is negative
	output error message
