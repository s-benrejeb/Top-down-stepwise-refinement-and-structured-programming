Problem 4

set number to 0
set increment variable to 0
set sum to 0

prompt user to enter the length of sequence of numbers to be summed
user inputs number

for increment variable starting at 1, increasing by 1 after every loop,
as long as increment is smaller or equal to input number
	set digit to 0
	prompt user to enter new digit
	user inputs new digit
	set sum equal to current sum + input digit

output final sum
